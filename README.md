### DOAJ Roadmap for the development of the platform (BETA)

[View our roadmap]()

Our roadmap provides our users, stakeholders, and partners with a vision of where DOAJ sees itself over the next two years. It provides a high-level view into our priorities for technical development.

This is a first attempt, a test at visualising the technical part of the work that we describe in [our strategy](). If this is successful, we will expand the Roadmap to include all aspects of DOAJ's work, from our volunteer program to our outreach and ambassador networks. 

The roadmap will show you what features or developments we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you.

## Roadmap stages
The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every column has a quarter and a year. The roadmap is for two years ahead. It is a fluid document and will change constantly. Items may appear or disappear, as we work on prioritising the different bits of work. 

Although we plan our work, some things may be added to the roadmap as need necessitates, particularly "housekeeping" or systems admin projects that are required to keep everything working smoothly.
