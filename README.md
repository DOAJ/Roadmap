## DOAJ Roadmap for developments of the service and the platform (2023-2025)

[View our roadmap](https://github.com/DOAJ/Roadmap/projects/1)

Our roadmap provides a view of some of the items that feed into [our strategic plan for 2023-2025](https://blog.doaj.org/2023/02/23/our-strategic-goals-for-2023-25/). This includes technical development of [the platform](https://doaj.org] .

### Roadmap stages
The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every column is grouped around each of our strategic themes. Items may appear or disappear, as we work on prioritising the different bits of work. Although we plan and prioritise our work in advance, some things may be added to the roadmap as need necessitates.
